# Transfer Learning From Xception, Inception, ResNet, and VGG Models


In transfer learning, the knowledge of a pre-trained machine learning model is applied to a different but related problem. For example, suppose you have trained a simple classifier to predict whether an image contains a backpack. In that case, you can use the knowledge the model has acquired during training to recognize other objects, such as sunglasses. For example, in computer vision, neural networks typically try to detect edges in early layers, shapes in middle layers, and some task-specific features in later layers. The initial and middle layers are used in transfer learning, and we only retrain the last layers. This helps to increase the labeled data related to the task it was initially trained on.

**We used pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks " Xception, Inception, ResNet, and VGG" to transfer learning on our data.**
